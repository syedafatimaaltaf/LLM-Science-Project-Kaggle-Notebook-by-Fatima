multiple-choice question answering task using the Hugging Face Transformers library.\n\n1. It imports necessary libraries, including `AutoTokenizer` from Transformers and `Dataset` from Datasets.\n\n2. The variable `MODEL_DIR` is set to the directory path where the pretrained BERT model is located.\n\n3. An instance of the BERT tokenizer is created using `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained()` with the specified BERT model directory.\n\n4. The `encode()` function is defined. This function takes a row from the training DataFrame (`train_df`) and performs the following steps:\n   - It retrieves the question prompt and options from the DataFrame row.\n   - It maps the answer labels ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E') to integer values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and gets the correct answer's integer ID.\n   - It tokenizes the question prompt and each option using the BERT tokenizer. The encoded result includes the question and option as a text pair, with truncation, padding, and a maximum sequence length of 512 tokens.\n   - It sets the 'labels' key in the encoded data dictionary to 1 if the current option is the correct answer, otherwise 0.\n   - It appends the encoded data to a list named `encoded_rows`.\n\n5. A loop iterates over each row in the `train_df` DataFrame. For each row, the `encode()` function is called, and the resulting encoded data is extended to the `encoded_train` list.\n\n6. After the loop, the `encoded_train` list contains dictionaries representing individual encoded examples.\n\n7. The `encoded_train` list is converted into a `Dataset` using the `Dataset.from_dict()` method. Each key in the dictionary corresponds to a key in the encoded examples, and the corresponding values are extracted and grouped together to form the dataset.\n\nAt this point, the `encoded_train_dataset` contains the encoded training data in the form of a `Dataset` that can be used for training a multiple-choice question answering model with the Transformers library.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import AutoTokenizer\nfrom datasets import Dataset\n\nMODEL_DIR = \"/kaggle/input/huggingface-bert/\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_DIR + \"bert-large-uncased\")\n\ndef encode(row):\n    # Format the context and the options.\n    prompt = str(row['prompt'])\n    options = [str(option) for option in row[['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']].values.tolist()]\n    \n    answer_mapping = {'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 3, 'E': 4}\n    correct_answer_id = answer_mapping[row['answer']]\n\n    encoded_rows = []\n    # Tokenize the question and the options, and include the correct answer label.\n    for idx, option in enumerate(options):\n        text_pair = [prompt, option]\n        encoded = tokenizer(text_pair, truncation = True, padding = 'max_length', max_length = 512)\n        \n        # We set the label to 1 if this is the correct answer, otherwise 0.\n        encoded['labels'] = 1 if idx == correct_answer_id else 0\n        encoded_rows.append(encoded)\n\n    return encoded_rows\n\nencoded_train = []\nfor _, row in train_df.iterrows():\n    encoded_train.extend(encode(row))\n\n# Now each item in encoded_train is a dictionary representing a single example.\n# We can convert it into a Dataset.\nencoded_train_dataset = Dataset.from_dict({key: [dic[key] for dic in encoded_train] for key in encoded_train[0]})","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-07T04:20:24.933056Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-07T04:20:24.933499Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-07T04:20:28.955234Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-07T04:20:24.933461Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-07T04:20:28.954231Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"encoded_train_dataset","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-07T04:20:33.946266Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-07T04:20:33.946877Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-07T04:20:33.953262Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-07T04:20:33.946844Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-07T04:20:33.952357Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"execution_count":3,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"Dataset({\n    features: ['input_ids', 'token_type_ids', 'attention_mask', 'labels'],\n    num_rows: 1000\n})"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# See the Labels","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(encoded_train_dataset['labels'][:10])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-07T04:20:37.590045Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-07T04:20:37.590408Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-07T04:20:37.597531Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-07T04:20:37.590379Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-07T04:20:37.595908Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"answer_mapping = {'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 3, 'E': 4}\ntrain_labels = train_df['answer'].map(answer_mapping)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-07T04:20:42.493573Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-07T04:20:42.493959Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-07T04:20:42.501884Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-07T04:20:42.493930Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-07T04:20:42.500822Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_labels","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-07T04:20:46.872454Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-07T04:20:46.872838Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-07T04:20:46.881925Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-07T04:20:46.872807Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-07T04:20:46.880920Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"execution_count":6,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"0      3\n1      0\n2      0\n3      2\n4      3\n      ..\n195    2\n196    1\n197    1\n198    3\n199    2\nName: answer, Length: 200, dtype: int64"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Initialize the Model\n\nWe need to initialize the LLM for fine-tuning. We use a version of the LLM that is **specifically designed for multiple-choice tasks**.\n\n**This time we use BERT-large.** The primary difference between the \"base\" and \"large\" versions of BERT models lies in **their size, which is reflected in the number of parameters they have, the number of transformer layers (i.e., the \"depth\" of the network), and the size of these layers (i.e., the \"width\" of the network)**. This directly impacts the model's capacity to learn from data, its computational requirements, and its performance on different tasks.\n\nHere's a quick comparison:\n\n    BERT-base: BERT-base models are smaller versions, with 12 transformer layers, each with a hidden size of 768, and 12 attention heads. This results in a total of about 110 million parameters.\n\n    BERT-large: BERT-large models are much bigger, with 24 transformer layers, each with a hidden size of 1024, and 16 attention heads. This results in a total of about 340 million parameters.\n\n**Because BERT-large models are larger and have more parameters, they have a greater capacity to learn and model complex patterns in data.** As a result, they typically perform better on tasks involving understanding natural language. **However, they also require more computational resources (both for training and inference), and the improvements they provide may not always justify the increased computational cost**, depending on the specific application and available resources.\n\n**The uncased model does not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters (it lowercases all input before tokenizing), whereas the cased model does keep the original letter cases.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import AutoModelForMultipleChoice\n\nmodel = AutoModelForMultipleChoice.from_pretrained(MODEL_DIR + \"bert-large-uncased\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-07T04:20:54.503256Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-07T04:20:54.503627Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-07T04:21:22.617276Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-07T04:20:54.503584Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-07T04:21:22.616291Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/scipy/__init__.py:146: UserWarning: A NumPy version >=1.16.5 and <1.23.0 is required for this version of SciPy (detected version 1.23.5\n  warnings.warn(f\"A NumPy version >={np_minversion} and <{np_maxversion}\"\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/__init__.py:98: UserWarning: unable to load libtensorflow_io_plugins.so: unable to open file: libtensorflow_io_plugins.so, from paths: ['/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/libtensorflow_io_plugins.so']\ncaused by: ['/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/libtensorflow_io_plugins.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3tsl6StatusC1EN10tensorflow5error4CodeESt17basic_string_viewIcSt11char_traitsIcEENS_14SourceLocationE']\n  warnings.warn(f\"unable to load libtensorflow_io_plugins.so: {e}\")\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/__init__.py:104: UserWarning: file system plugins are not loaded: unable to open file: libtensorflow_io.so, from paths: ['/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/libtensorflow_io.so']\ncaused by: ['/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/libtensorflow_io.so: undefined symbol: _ZTVN10tensorflow13GcsFileSystemE']\n  warnings.warn(f\"file system plugins are not loaded: {e}\")\nSome weights of the model checkpoint at /kaggle/input/huggingface-bert/bert-large-uncased were not used when initializing BertForMultipleChoice: ['cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias']\n- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForMultipleChoice from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).\n- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForMultipleChoice from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).\nSome weights of BertForMultipleChoice were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /kaggle/input/huggingface-bert/bert-large-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']\nYou should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Train the Model\n\nFinally, we can train the model using a library like Hugging Face's Transformers, which provides an easy-to-use Trainer class.
